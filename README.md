Starbound Install Script
======================

####What is this?
This is an automatic starbound server install script. Running this script will
install the latest version of starbound on a linode server (or linux server).

####Why this?
Starbound is a great game. It's even better with friends. Unfortunately, it's a
pretty big pain to setup especially if you aren't familiar with linux. This is an
easy way to setup a starbound server and voice server combo so that you and your
friends can play.

####Tested Installs?
If you install on a flavor that hasn't been tested, let me know in the issues or
fork and update this script.

####How do I do this? (Step By Step)
First, go to https://www.linode.com/?r=9c1631b4c816495758ee7c83a24262f50246d771 and
sign up for a server. If it's only a couple people playing the you can get the cheapest
one for about $0.015/hr. If you don't want to use my referral link you can sign
up without the link. There are many other providers, I have tried most of them. I recommend
linode whether or not you use my referral code.
