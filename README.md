Starbound Install Script
======================

####What is this?
This is an automatic starbound server install script. Running this script will
install the latest version of starbound on a linode server as well as a mumble
server on the same machine. 
This script was made specifically for a 12.04LTS Ubuntu linode node. It may or may
not work with other Ubuntu flavors from other providers. 

####Why this?
Starbound is a great game. It's even better with friends. Unfortunately, it's a
pretty big pain to setup especially if you aren't familiar with linux. This is an
easy way to setup a starbound server and voice server combo so that you and your
friends can play.

####How do I do this? (Step By Step)
First, go to https://www.linode.com/?r=9c1631b4c816495758ee7c83a24262f50246d771 and
sign up for a server. If it's only a couple people playing the you can get the cheapest
one for about $0.015/hr. If you don't want to use my referral link you can sign 
up without the link.
